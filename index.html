            <p>When originally brainstorming the planning for the event, we thought it was a good idea to organizer a fundraiser for THON on campus because it is the biggest fundraising event in the Penn State community, and it also is the world's largest student-run philanthropy event. We had to coordinate and plan on which day to hold the event, as well as the location. We knew it had to be during a large event for the community to be able to gather the most amount of support and donations possible. To help us plan and get approval, we contacted Amy Gartley to make sure that we were able to be able to collect donations for THON as students at Penn State. She then put us in contact with the THON club at Penn State Beaver, which helped us set up and coordinate where we would be holding the fundraising. We chose to do the event on Friday, November 29*h, from 5-9 PM at the Beaver light up night, which was in downtown Beaver. To advertise the fundraising, we also coordinated with the THON club to make a set of materials for the event, including flyers, signs, wristbands, cookies, and an informational bulletin board.</p>
            <p>At the event, we started out by having two of us at the fundraising table, passing out cookies and wrist bands, and two of us passing out flyers and asking people if they were familiar with THON and explaining what the purpose of THON is, which is to raise money to help childhood cancer. Throughout the event many people showed their interest in us raising money for THON and thought it was a great idea even if they did not donate. When it got too cold for us at times, we would take turns standing by the fire to warm our hands, while all doing our part to take turns to support the fundraising efforts. We were impressed by the local communities' support for the cause and were able to get the word out about THON to many people. We noticed that many of the people who donated had either kids with them or were Penn State alumnus, which gave them a personal connection to the cause. Despite the freezing weather, we were able to come together for the duration of the event and raise a few hundred dollars in cash as well as many more online donations. After the event was over, we made sure to clean up our table and to finish giving out the rest of the cookies and wrist bands to passersby. A representative from the THON group ended up coming to assist us with this.</p> 
            <p>After reflecting on the event, as a group we learned many networking techniques, and how to talk to people in a business-like manner without being too aggressive but still getting the point across.</p>
